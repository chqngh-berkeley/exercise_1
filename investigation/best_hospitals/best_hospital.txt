What hospitals are models of high-quality care?
That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.

To find the hospitals with the high-quality care, I aggregated the Procedure_T by
Hospitals and computed the average Score of TimelyAndEffectiveCare. The data then ranks
the average across procedures for the hospitals and produce the top 10 results.
I pruned out the Procedure Scores that are null or over 200 because I consider them outliers.
