Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

To find the procedures with the greatest variability, I took the standard
deviation of procedures's TimelyAndEffectiveCareScore. I did this by first
grouping the Procedures by MeasureID, then I computed the standard deviation(stddev_pop in Hive)
of the scores and ranked them in descending order. Then I took the top 10 results, the 10
with the greatest standard deviation, therefore the greatest variance(variability).
