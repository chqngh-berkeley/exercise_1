Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

To find whether there is a correlation, I calculated the Pearson's R coefficient
between HCAHPSBase score(from SurveyResults Table) and avg score for hospital quality(see best_hospital.sql)
as well as the HCAHPSBase score against the procedural variability.

The Pearson's coefficient between HCAHPSBase and avgTimelyAndEffectiveCareScore
is -0.057182781344855084, indicating no correlation.

The Pearson's coefficient between HCAHPSBase and standarad deviation of TimelyAndEffectiveCareScore
0.2218446865124282, indicating a weak positive correlation.
